## Objectives, alerting, and signal quality

Consult primary guidance for success definitions, evaluation windows, alert quality, instrumentation, and measurement gaps.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Implementing SLOs](https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/) | Review practical service-level objective design and adoption. | Intermediate; useful measures depend on service behavior and user expectations. |
| [SLO engineering case studies](https://sre.google/workbook/slo-engineering-case-studies/) | Compare service-objective decisions and measurement approaches in concrete cases. | Intermediate; public chapter. Keep the service boundary and user expectations explicit. |
| [Example SLO document](https://sre.google/workbook/slo-document/) | Review a worked document connecting service indicators, targets, and measurement details. | Foundation onward; public appendix. Adapt the scope and data sources instead of copying its numbers. |
| [Example error budget policy](https://sre.google/workbook/error-budget-policy/) | Find a concrete example of how reliability evidence can influence change decisions. | Intermediate; public appendix. A policy needs agreed authority, exceptions, and a measured service boundary. |
| [Alerting on SLOs](https://sre.google/workbook/alerting-on-slos/) | Compare alerting approaches based on reliability objectives and budget consumption. | Advanced; validate alert behavior against real traffic and responder capacity. |
| [Prometheus querying basics](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) | Read query semantics before interpreting rates, ranges, and label-based aggregation. | Intermediate; public reference. Queries can omit traffic or combine unrelated services if labels are wrong. |
| [Prometheus recording rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/) | Plan reusable query results and rule evaluation for operational dashboards and alerts. | Intermediate; public reference. Rule evaluation load and failure visibility require operational review. |
| [Prometheus alerting rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/) | Define actionable alert conditions and understand their evaluation behavior. | Intermediate; public reference. Alert expressions need routing, ownership, and diagnostic context. |
| [Prometheus instrumentation practices](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/instrumentation/) | Select metrics and labels that answer operating questions without uncontrolled cardinality. | Intermediate; public guide. Instrumentation overhead and confidential label values need review. |
| [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) | Review telemetry reception, processing, export, and deployment concerns. | Intermediate; size for throughput and failure conditions and evaluate sensitive-data handling. |

## Runtime and dependency behavior

Check release-specific production, probe, resource, disruption, storage, network, and state behavior. Recovery assumptions should be backed by an implementation-specific test.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Production Kubernetes environments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/) | Compare production setup considerations and operating models. | Advanced; managed services retain workload and configuration responsibilities. |
| [Liveness, readiness, and startup probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) | Review health-check semantics and configuration. | Intermediate; unsuitable checks can cause restart loops or hide unavailable dependencies. |
| [Container resource management](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) | Review requests, limits, scheduling, and resource constraints. | Intermediate; workload measurements and node capacity are needed for useful settings. |
| [Kubernetes disruptions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/) | Understand availability during voluntary and involuntary disruptions. | Intermediate; a disruption budget is not a universal guarantee against outages. |
| [Kubernetes persistent volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) | Review storage binding, access modes, reclaim policy, and volume lifecycle. | Intermediate; public conceptual reference. Removing a claim can have data consequences depending on reclaim policy and storage implementation. |
| [Kubernetes NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) | Review traffic-control semantics and policy examples. | Intermediate; enforcement depends on the network implementation and its supported behavior. |
| [Kubernetes application troubleshooting](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/) | Locate workload debugging references for deployment and runtime failures. | Intermediate; establish scope before applying changes. Read permissions and command effects. |
| [Operating etcd for Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/) | Find etcd configuration, maintenance, and recovery guidance for self-managed control planes. | Advanced; public task guide. Quorum changes and restores affect cluster state; managed providers have separate responsibility boundaries. |
| [PostgreSQL statistics and activity](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html) | Investigate sessions, activity, waits, and collected database statistics. | Intermediate; public reference. Visibility permissions and collection timing affect what you can conclude. |
| [PostgreSQL explicit locking](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html) | Understand lock conflicts and deadlock behavior before intervening in blocked database work. | Intermediate; public reference. Terminating a session can abort transactions and affect application behavior. |
| [PostgreSQL EXPLAIN guidance](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html) | Read execution plans and investigate query behavior with documented planner concepts. | Intermediate; public guide. EXPLAIN ANALYZE executes the query; use controlled targets for statements with side effects. |

## Automation and change mechanics

Read test, state, runner, and configuration behavior before changing a production workflow. Preserve usable access and recovery material when a control system is unavailable.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Terraform state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state) | Understand infrastructure mappings and state behavior before designing shared automation. | Intermediate; state may contain sensitive data. Protect storage and recovery procedures. |
| [Terraform state locking](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/locking) | Understand concurrent-run protection and when backend locking is available. | Intermediate; public reference. Investigate lock ownership before unlocking; a lock is not a state backup. |
| [Terraform testing](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/tests) | Review native test structures for modules and infrastructure workflows. | Intermediate; some test arrangements create resources. Read execution and cleanup behavior first. |
| [Ansible error handling](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_error_handling.html) | Define failures, changed results, handler behavior, and stopping conditions for multi-host execution. | Intermediate; publicly readable reference. Ignoring an error can conceal incomplete configuration; unreachable hosts need separate handling. |
| [Ansible check and diff modes](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_checkmode.html) | Review simulated changes and configuration differences before a deployment. | Intermediate; public reference. Module support varies, explicit task settings can allow changes, and diff output may expose secrets. |
| [GitHub self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/runners/self-hosted-runners) | Assess responsibility for runner machines and their execution environments. | Intermediate; public documentation. Untrusted jobs, persistent workspaces, network reachability, and patching require deliberate controls. |
| [GitHub Actions security guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions) | Review workflow, dependency, runner, and credential security considerations. | Intermediate; apply the guidance to the repository trust model and runner arrangement. |
| [GitLab Runner documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) | Design and operate execution infrastructure for GitLab pipelines. | Advanced; executor choice changes isolation and maintenance responsibilities. |
| [Jenkins backup and restore](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/backing-up/) | Plan recovery of controller configuration and data rather than only rebuilding agents. | Intermediate; public operating guide. Protect backed-up secrets and exercise restore in an isolated environment. |
| [Configuration design and best practices](https://sre.google/workbook/configuration-design/) | Review interfaces, validation, and change control for configuration-driven systems. | Intermediate; public chapter. Syntax validation alone cannot establish a safe operational change. |

## Recovery and external health

Use backup, restore, database failover, and provider-health documentation alongside service observations. A provider report is supporting context rather than the entire incident diagnosis.

| --- | --- | --- |
| [PostgreSQL backup and restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup.html) | Review database backup approaches and their operational implications. | Advanced; use documentation matching the deployed database version and test restored data. |
| [pgBackRest command reference](https://pgbackrest.org/command.html) | Check command options for controlled backup and restore experiments. | Advanced; public CLI reference. Restore operations can replace database files; use an isolated target and retire only designated test storage, preserving required source backups. |
| [PostgreSQL high availability and replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/high-availability.html) | Compare replication and standby arrangements, failure behavior, and responsibility boundaries. | Advanced; public reference. Replication lag, failover fencing, and application reconnection affect actual availability. |
| [AWS Health documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/) | Find provider-event visibility and account-specific health information guidance. | Intermediate; public documentation. Provider status is one signal; it does not replace your own service measurements. |
| [Azure Service Health documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/) | Review provider incident, maintenance, and advisory visibility for Azure workloads. | Foundation onward; public reference. Access to account-specific information requires appropriate subscription permissions. |
