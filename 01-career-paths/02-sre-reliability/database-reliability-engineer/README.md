# Database reliability engineer

[SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

Resources for database availability, correctness, durability, query performance, replication, maintenance, backup, and recovery. The collection prioritizes database-specific operating references and treats connection pools, application retries, replication, and restore procedures as parts of the same service boundary.

## Find a resource

Use the collections below for the task in front of you. Compare purpose, prerequisites, deployment model, and operating limitations before choosing a tool or applying a guide. The tools are alternatives or complementary components, not a required stack.

## Resource collections

| Collection | What you will find |
| --- | --- |
| [Tool directory](toolkit.md) | Tools grouped by implementation or operating task, with alternatives and selection notes. |
| [Official documentation](official-documentation.md) | Authoritative manuals, API references, and focused operating guides. |
| [Reference architectures and design guidance](reference-architectures.md) | Documented designs, patterns, assumptions, and decision resources. |
| [Learning resources](learning-resources.md) | Books, tutorials, research, talks, and discovery collections by topic. |
| [Labs, examples, and projects](labs-and-projects.md) | Practice environments, examples, workshops, and implementation repositories. |
| [Production responsibilities and operational resources](production-responsibilities.md) | Operating concerns connected to diagnostic, incident, and recovery resources. |
| [Standards and frameworks](standards-and-frameworks.md) | Specifications, security guidance, and review frameworks with scope distinctions. |
| [Related careers](related-careers.md) | Adjacent collections, their overlap, and their development status. |

## Useful starting points

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [PostgreSQL statistics and activity](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html) | Investigate sessions, activity, waits, and collected database statistics. | Intermediate; public reference. Visibility permissions and collection timing affect what you can conclude. |
| [PostgreSQL explicit locking](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html) | Understand lock conflicts and deadlock behavior before intervening in blocked database work. | Intermediate; public reference. Terminating a session can abort transactions and affect application behavior. |
| [PostgreSQL continuous archiving and recovery](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html) | Review write-ahead log archiving, recovery configuration, and recovery dependencies. | Advanced; public reference. Restore correctness requires the needed base backup and complete relevant archive history. |
| [PostgreSQL high availability and replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/high-availability.html) | Compare replication and standby arrangements, failure behavior, and responsibility boundaries. | Advanced; public reference. Replication lag, failover fencing, and application reconnection affect actual availability. |
| [pgBackRest user guide](https://pgbackrest.org/user-guide.html) | Review PostgreSQL backup, archive, restore, and repository workflows. | Advanced; public project guide. Secure backup credentials and validate restores with the matching database version. |
| [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) | Find the author's book information and supporting resources for data-system design. | Intermediate to advanced; public book website. Full books are separate purchases; choose an edition and check publication details. |

## Coverage

- Sessions, queries, locks and waits.
- Connections and resource bottlenecks.
- Replication, failover and fencing.
- Durability, integrity and transaction semantics.
- Backup, point-in-time recovery and restores.
- Maintenance and schema-change risk.
- Database objectives, telemetry and incidents.

## Reading and access

Foundation material assumes limited topic experience; intermediate material usually assumes basic implementation knowledge; advanced material often assumes practical systems or production experience. Each entry narrows those expectations where needed. Publicly readable instructions do not make a hosted service, commercial book, software license, or cloud experiment free.

Resource descriptions and destinations were reviewed on **5 October 2026**. Version, preview, development, and historical notes identify material that needs particular care. The linked manuals and collections are not claimed to have been read or tested in full. External links are used while repository resource IDs and canonical mappings remain unassigned.
