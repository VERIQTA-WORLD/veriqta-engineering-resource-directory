# Reliability engineer: reference architectures and design guidance

[Career overview](README.md) · [SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

Use these designs, patterns, and engineering accounts to test assumptions and compare alternatives. Provider blueprints, project guides, community principles, and formal specifications have different scopes.

## Failure models and containment

Compare mechanisms for overload, shared failures, retries, and static stability. Document where the design can still fail.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Google SRE: handling overload](https://sre.google/sre-book/handling-overload/) | Study admission control, throttling, and overload behavior before increasing concurrency or capacity. | Intermediate; public book chapter. Google's implementations illustrate mechanisms, not settings to copy unchanged. |
| [Addressing cascading failures](https://sre.google/sre-book/addressing-cascading-failures/) | Review overload, feedback loops, and failure propagation. | Advanced; validate containment strategies with bounded tests and measurements. |
| [AWS Builders' Library: static stability](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/static-stability-using-availability-zones/) | Review designs that retain useful capacity during failures without depending on immediate expansion. | Advanced; public engineering article. AWS examples require workload-specific capacity and dependency analysis. |
| [AWS Builders' Library: workload isolation](https://d1.awsstatic.com/builderslibrary/pdfs/workload-isolation-using-shuffle-sharding.pdf) | Explore isolation patterns for limiting correlated impact across tenants and workloads. | Advanced; public original engineering article in PDF. Historical design account; adapt failure domains and assumptions to the actual workload. |
| [Azure bulkhead pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/bulkhead) | Explore resource isolation between workloads and dependency paths. | Intermediate; public pattern. Isolation adds capacity and routing decisions; test the boundaries actually enforced. |
| [Azure circuit breaker pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker) | Compare dependency-failure containment and recovery-probe behavior. | Intermediate; public pattern. Thresholds and reset behavior must match the dependency and user impact. |
| [Principles of Chaos Engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/) | Frame experiments around a steady-state hypothesis and measured failure behavior. | Intermediate; public community principles. They do not authorize production testing or guarantee an experiment's safety. |

## State correctness and recovery design

Review consistency, data integrity, replication, backup, and restore assumptions together. Provider disaster-recovery guidance must be adapted to the state actually held.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Distributed consensus for reliability](https://sre.google/sre-book/managing-critical-state/) | Study critical state, consensus, and the operational consequences of distributed coordination. | Advanced; public chapter. Quorum assumptions differ from ordinary replica-count assumptions. |
| [Data integrity: what you read is what you wrote](https://sre.google/sre-book/data-integrity/) | Investigate durability, corruption detection, and integrity as distinct reliability concerns. | Advanced; public chapter. Replication and availability do not prove correct data or successful recovery. |
| [PostgreSQL high availability and replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/high-availability.html) | Compare replication and standby arrangements, failure behavior, and responsibility boundaries. | Advanced; public reference. Replication lag, failover fencing, and application reconnection affect actual availability. |
| [PostgreSQL continuous archiving and recovery](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html) | Review write-ahead log archiving, recovery configuration, and recovery dependencies. | Advanced; public reference. Restore correctness requires the needed base backup and complete relevant archive history. |
| [PostgreSQL backup and restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup.html) | Review database backup approaches and their operational implications. | Advanced; use documentation matching the deployed database version and test restored data. |
| [AWS disaster recovery guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws.html) | Compare recovery strategies and resilience considerations for AWS workloads. | Advanced; define recovery time and recovery point objectives and test the complete workload. |
| [Azure reliability disaster-recovery guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/disaster-recovery-overview) | Locate Azure disaster-recovery concepts and planning guidance. | Advanced; service support and workload dependencies determine feasible recovery objectives. |
| [Google Cloud disaster recovery planning guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/dr-scenarios-planning-guide) | Review recovery planning, objectives, and scenario selection. | Advanced; test identity, configuration, data, and traffic restoration together. |

## Architecture review and decisions

Use provider frameworks and design notation to record options, constraints, evidence, and unresolved risks. A diagram should identify operationally significant dependencies.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html) | Review workload decisions across operational, reliability, security, performance, cost, and sustainability concerns. | Intermediate to advanced; AWS-specific guidance. Adapt recommendations to requirements. |
| [Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/) | Review Azure workload architecture and quality trade-offs. | Intermediate to advanced; assess workload context rather than treating guidance as a universal checklist. |
| [Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework) | Review Google Cloud architecture guidance across its documented pillars. | Intermediate to advanced; provider-specific capabilities and assumptions need review. |
| [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) | Describe software systems at useful levels of architectural abstraction. | Foundation onward; diagrams communicate structure but do not establish operational correctness. |
| [Architecture Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/) | Find guidance and resources for recording architectural decisions. | Foundation onward; keep decisions connected to evidence and later changes. |
| [Cloud design patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/) | Compare patterns addressing distributed-system concerns and trade-offs. | Intermediate; examples are provider-oriented, while many problem statements apply more broadly. |
| [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) | Review application configuration, deployment, and operability principles. | Foundation to intermediate; useful design guidance, not a complete security or resilience architecture. |
