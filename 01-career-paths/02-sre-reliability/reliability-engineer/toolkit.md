## Outcome measurement and diagnosis

Choose tools that connect symptoms to service behavior and resource evidence. Metrics, traces, logs, profiles, and packet captures answer different questions.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) | Evaluate metrics collection, querying, and monitoring architecture. | Intermediate; plan label cardinality, retention, storage, and availability. |
| [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/) | Build and govern dashboards and documented observability integrations. | Intermediate; distinguish the operated software from cloud services and edition-specific capabilities. |
| [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) | Plan instrumentation, telemetry collection, and export across system components. | Intermediate; select signal pipelines and backends deliberately. Review data sensitivity and collector capacity. |
| [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/) | Review distributed tracing components and deployment guidance. | Intermediate; instrumentation coverage and sampling affect what can be observed. |
| [Grafana Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/) | Evaluate log aggregation, storage, queries, and deployment approaches. | Advanced; ingestion volume, label design, retention, and tenancy affect cost and performance. |
| [Prometheus Blackbox Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter) | Probe selected network and service endpoints from an external observation point. | Intermediate; public project repository. Probe location, credentials, and traffic volume change what results mean. |
| [Parca documentation](https://www.parca.dev/docs/overview/) | Explore continuous profiling for investigating resource consumption over time. | Advanced; public project documentation. Collection permissions, symbolization, and profile storage need review. |
| [Wireshark User's Guide](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/) | Inspect capture and protocol-analysis workflows for network diagnosis. | Intermediate; capture only with authorization. Traffic may contain sensitive data and encrypted payloads may remain unreadable. The linked manual currently displays development version 4.7.4; match the installed release. |
| [Prometheus Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) | Collect host metrics for resource pressure and infrastructure monitoring. | Intermediate; public project repository. Review enabled collectors, privileges, and host access boundaries. |

## Objective and alert management

Select an objective representation and evaluation method suitable for the service. Review missing data, aggregation, burn-rate logic, and routing separately.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Sloth](https://sloth.dev/) | Compare an SLO-to-Prometheus rule generator for service monitoring workflows. | Intermediate; public project documentation. Correct generated rules still require valid indicators and label boundaries. |
| [Pyrra](https://github.com/pyrra-dev/pyrra) | Evaluate SLO definition and visualization tooling around Prometheus-based measurements. | Intermediate; public project repository. Review deployment requirements and the service's actual measurement coverage. |
| [OpenSLO](https://openslo.com/) | Review a shared specification for expressing service-level objectives and related metadata. | Intermediate; public specification project. Implementation support and supported schema versions vary. |
| [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) | Design alert grouping, routing, inhibition, and notification integration. | Intermediate; routing does not establish that an alert is actionable. Test ownership and delivery. |
| [Prometheus recording rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/) | Plan reusable query results and rule evaluation for operational dashboards and alerts. | Intermediate; public reference. Rule evaluation load and failure visibility require operational review. |
| [Prometheus alerting rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/) | Define actionable alert conditions and understand their evaluation behavior. | Intermediate; public reference. Alert expressions need routing, ownership, and diagnostic context. |
| [Prometheus rule unit tests](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/unit_testing_rules/) | Test rule behavior against synthetic time-series inputs before changing production alerts. | Intermediate; public practical reference. Synthetic series do not establish live scrape or routing correctness. |

## Test and failure evidence

Compare functional, infrastructure, load, dependency-fault, and platform-fault approaches. A passing test establishes only what that test exercised.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) | Test Python automation with fixtures, assertions, parametrization, and temporary environments. | Intermediate; public project documentation. Mocks cannot establish that a live provider behaves correctly. |
| [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/guides/) | Find guides for container-backed integration test dependencies. | Intermediate; runtime and language-library requirements vary. Tests still need meaningful assertions. |
| [Grafana k6](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/) | Evaluate programmable load and performance testing. | Intermediate; model real traffic and service objectives. External targets need explicit test authorization. |
| [Locust](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/) | Assess Python-based load modeling and distributed test execution. | Intermediate; confirm the documentation release, because moving branches can expose development builds. Workload design and load-generator limits affect conclusions. |
| [Toxiproxy](https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy) | Introduce controlled connection faults between a test client and service. | Intermediate; public project repository and examples. Confine the proxy to authorized test traffic and remove injected faults afterward. |
| [Chaos Toolkit documentation](https://chaostoolkit.org/) | Explore experiment definitions, drivers, and execution guidance for hypothesis-based failure testing. | Advanced; public project documentation. Extensions need separate review; experiments can affect availability and data. |
| [Chaos Mesh](https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/) | Explore Kubernetes failure-injection experiments. | Advanced; use isolated environments and bounded experiments before considering production use. |
| [LitmusChaos](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/) | Compare chaos experimentation and workflow capabilities. | Advanced; assess permissions, compatibility, failure scope, and recovery controls. |
| [Ansible Molecule](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/molecule/) | Evaluate scenarios for developing and testing Ansible collections, playbooks, and roles. | Intermediate; public documentation. Scenario drivers and targets determine infrastructure, privileges, and cleanup requirements. |

## Change and policy controls

Review deployment control, infrastructure state, policy behavior, and artifact provenance. Keep the validation evidence connected to the version actually deployed.

| --- | --- | --- |
| [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) | Compare application synchronization, repository integration, and Kubernetes deployment management. | Intermediate; define repository and cluster trust boundaries, controller availability, and recovery. |
| [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/) | Evaluate controller-based GitOps reconciliation for Kubernetes sources and workloads. | Intermediate; design source permissions, reconciliation ownership, bootstrap, and recovery. |
| [Argo Rollouts](https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) | Assess canary and blue-green rollout controls and analysis integration. | Advanced; traffic routing and metrics integrations determine what a rollout can actually verify. |
| [Flagger](https://docs.flagger.app/) | Explore automated progressive delivery with traffic-management and metric integrations. | Advanced; verify supported providers and analysis behavior for the chosen environment. |
| [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs) | Assess declarative provisioning, providers, state, and reusable configuration. | Intermediate; review backend protection and provider behavior. Product edition and license terms need separate review. |
| [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/) | Evaluate declarative infrastructure provisioning and its documented state and workflow features. | Intermediate; verify provider, module, and state compatibility for your migration instead of assuming interchangeability. |
| [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/) | Evaluate general policy evaluation and integration patterns. | Advanced; the integrating system must enforce the decision. Test policy and failure behavior. |
| [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/docs/) | Assess Kubernetes policy validation, mutation, and other documented policy capabilities. | Intermediate; evaluate admission availability, exceptions, enforcement mode, and policy tests. |
| [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/docs/) | Evaluate vulnerability and configuration assessment within build and deployment workflows. | Intermediate; findings need prioritization and exceptions. Scan success does not establish artifact safety. |
| [Sigstore Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/signing/overview/) | Design artifact signing and verification workflows. | Advanced; define trusted identities, verification policy, and failure handling. A signature does not prove software quality. |

## State, recovery, and capacity tools

Use tools matched to the state and bottleneck under review. Backup success, failover, replication, and restore correctness need separate evidence.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [pgBackRest user guide](https://pgbackrest.org/user-guide.html) | Review PostgreSQL backup, archive, restore, and repository workflows. | Advanced; public project guide. Secure backup credentials and validate restores with the matching database version. |
| [Patroni documentation](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | Compare PostgreSQL high-availability orchestration and its distributed coordination dependencies. | Advanced; public project reference. Review fencing, datastore behavior, failover policy, and recovery; an orchestrator is not a backup. |
| [PgBouncer documentation](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html) | Compare connection pooling behavior, resource settings, and application compatibility. | Intermediate; public configuration reference. Pooling mode and session-dependent application features affect correctness. |
| [Velero](https://velero.io/docs/) | Review Kubernetes backup, restore, and migration workflows. | Advanced; validate storage-provider support and application consistency. A completed backup is not a proven restore. |
| [PostgreSQL pgbench](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgbench.html) | Explore database workload generation and benchmark interpretation in a disposable database. | Intermediate; public CLI guide. Initialization and workloads modify data and can saturate the server; remove the test database when finished. |
| [fio documentation](https://fio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | Design controlled storage workload tests and interpret latency and throughput reports. | Advanced; public workload-generator manual currently built from a development revision. Use version-matched options and disposable test files; raw-device jobs can destroy data. |
| [iperf3 documentation](https://software.es.net/iperf/) | Generate controlled throughput measurements between authorized network endpoints. | Intermediate; public project documentation. Traffic can saturate a path; coordinate endpoints and stop servers and tests afterward. |
| [OpenCost](https://opencost.io/docs/) | Explore Kubernetes cost allocation and cost visibility. | Intermediate; allocation assumptions, data quality, and shared costs need review. |

## Incident coordination options

Compare incident workflows, ownership, escalation, and integration requirements. These hosted tools support coordination; they do not replace service objectives, diagnosis, or an agreed response process.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [PagerDuty incident documentation](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/incidents) | Inspect incident states, ownership, response, and notification behavior in a hosted incident platform. | Intermediate; public vendor documentation.
