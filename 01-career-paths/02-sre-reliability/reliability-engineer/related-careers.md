# Reliability engineer: related careers

[Career overview](README.md) · [SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

These collections overlap in reliability concerns but emphasize different engineering boundaries. Role ownership varies by organization; use the scope descriptions to find the resources you need.

## Adjacent resource collections

| Career | Distinct emphasis and overlap | Collection status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Site reliability engineer](../site-reliability-engineer/README.md) | Resources for applying engineering to service operations: service objectives, observability, on-call response, incident learning, safe changes, capacity, automation, and recovery. | Included in this folder. |
| [Service reliability engineer](../service-reliability-engineer/README.md) | Resources for operating an individual service or connected service boundary: user-facing outcomes, dependencies, latency, correctness, change safety, capacity, and recovery. | Included in this folder. |
| [Resilience engineer](../resilience-engineer/README.md) | Resources for preserving useful service during faults and recovering after disruption. | Included in this folder. |
| [Chaos engineer](../chaos-engineer/README.md) | Resources for designing controlled failure experiments, collecting steady-state evidence, limiting blast radius, and validating recovery. | Included in this folder. |
| [Capacity engineer](../capacity-engineer/README.md) | Resources for measuring demand, identifying bottlenecks, forecasting resource needs, and validating the capacity available during normal operation and failures. | Included in this folder. |

## Shared references

These direct references remain useful when moving between the adjacent collections. Their inclusion does not make the roles interchangeable.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Implementing SLOs](https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/) | Review practical service-level objective design and adoption. | Intermediate; useful measures depend on service behavior and user expectations. |
| [Testing for reliability](https://sre.google/sre-book/testing-reliability/) | Compare test types and their relationship to failure detection and operational confidence. | Intermediate; public chapter. A passing test covers its scenarios, not every failure mode. |
| [Effective troubleshooting](https://sre.google/sre-book/effective-troubleshooting/) | Use hypotheses and evidence to narrow a production failure rather than change unrelated settings. | Foundation onward; public chapter. Its method complements product-specific diagnostic references. |
| [Cloud design patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/) | Compare patterns addressing distributed-system concerns and trade-offs. | Intermediate; examples are provider-oriented, while many problem statements apply more broadly. |
| [Postmortem culture](https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/) | Review incident learning, documentation, and follow-up practices. | Intermediate; focus on evidenced contributing factors and actionable improvement. |
