# Platform reliability engineer

[SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

Resources for keeping shared developer and runtime platforms dependable: provisioning, reconciliation, build and delivery services, artifact distribution, identity, telemetry, and recovery. The focus is the platform as a service with its own users, objectives, failure boundaries, and operating costs.

## Find a resource

Use the collections below for the task in front of you. Compare purpose, prerequisites, deployment model, and operating limitations before choosing a tool or applying a guide. The tools are alternatives or complementary components, not a required stack.

## Resource collections

| Collection | What you will find |
| --- | --- |
| [Tool directory](toolkit.md) | Tools grouped by implementation or operating task, with alternatives and selection notes. |
| [Official documentation](official-documentation.md) | Authoritative manuals, API references, and focused operating guides. |
| [Reference architectures and design guidance](reference-architectures.md) | Documented designs, patterns, assumptions, and decision resources. |
| [Learning resources](learning-resources.md) | Books, tutorials, research, talks, and discovery collections by topic. |
| [Labs, examples, and projects](labs-and-projects.md) | Practice environments, examples, workshops, and implementation repositories. |
| [Production responsibilities and operational resources](production-responsibilities.md) | Operating concerns connected to diagnostic, incident, and recovery resources. |
| [Standards and frameworks](standards-and-frameworks.md) | Specifications, security guidance, and review frameworks with scope distinctions. |
| [Related careers](related-careers.md) | Adjacent collections, their overlap, and their development status. |

## Useful starting points

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CNCF Platforms White Paper](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platforms/) | Review platform capabilities, organizational context, and platform thinking. | Intermediate; platform design must start with developer and operator needs. |
| [Implementing SLOs](https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/) | Review practical service-level objective design and adoption. | Intermediate; useful measures depend on service behavior and user expectations. |
| [Backstage software catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/) | Model service ownership and metadata discovery for a developer portal. | Intermediate; public documentation. Catalog metadata is not proof that a service meets production controls. |
| [Production Kubernetes environments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/) | Compare production setup considerations and operating models. | Advanced; managed services retain workload and configuration responsibilities. |
| [Reliable product launches](https://sre.google/sre-book/reliable-product-launches/) | Compare readiness review, launch coordination, and production-risk reduction. | Intermediate; public book chapter. Select checks appropriate to the service and the people who own it. |

## Coverage

- Platform service boundaries and user journeys.
- Shared-control-plane dependencies.
- Provisioning and reconciliation.
- Delivery and artifact availability.
- Tenant isolation and identity.
- Telemetry backend health.
- State recovery, upgrades and platform incidents.

## Reading and access

Foundation material assumes limited topic experience; intermediate material usually assumes basic implementation knowledge; advanced material often assumes practical systems or production experience. Each entry narrows those expectations where needed. Publicly readable instructions do not make a hosted service, commercial book, software license, or cloud experiment free.

Resource descriptions and destinations were reviewed on **5 October 2026**. Version, preview, development, and historical notes identify material that needs particular care. The linked manuals and collections are not claimed to have been read or tested in full. External links are used while repository resource IDs and canonical mappings remain unassigned.
