# Chaos engineer: tool directory

[Career overview](README.md) · [SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

Compare tools by the engineering task, execution environment, integration boundaries, and operating effort. Public documentation access does not establish that hosted services, licenses, or infrastructure use are free.

## Experiment engines and provider options

Choose around the actual target, supported actions, permissions, and recovery mechanism. A test engine does not establish safe scope or authorize production access.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Chaos Toolkit documentation](https://chaostoolkit.org/) | Explore experiment definitions, drivers, and execution guidance for hypothesis-based failure testing. | Advanced; public project documentation. Extensions need separate review; experiments can affect availability and data. |
| [Chaos Mesh](https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/) | Explore Kubernetes failure-injection experiments. | Advanced; use isolated environments and bounded experiments before considering production use. |
| [LitmusChaos](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/) | Compare chaos experimentation and workflow capabilities. | Advanced; assess permissions, compatibility, failure scope, and recovery controls. |
| [AWS Fault Injection Service documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/what-is.html) | Review managed fault experiments, targets, actions, and operating controls. | Advanced; public documentation. AWS account permissions and charges apply; review stop conditions and each action's recovery behavior. |
| [Azure Chaos Studio Workspaces documentation (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/) | Evaluate Azure fault experiments and service-specific target requirements. | Intermediate to advanced; public documentation for a preview service. Check feature scope, supported targets, account requirements, and preview limitations before planning an experiment. |

## Dependency, network, and resource faults

Use targeted tools when a specific fault is enough to test the hypothesis. Stress and packet inspection require careful target and data boundaries.

| --- | --- | --- |
| [Toxiproxy](https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy) | Introduce controlled connection faults between a test client and service. | Intermediate; public project repository and examples. Confine the proxy to authorized test traffic and remove injected faults afterward. |
| [stress-ng](https://github.com/ColinIanKing/stress-ng) | Explore controlled resource stressors for testing host and workload behavior. | Advanced; public project repository. Stressors can destabilize a host; use disposable environments and stop all stress processes afterward. |
| [containerlab documentation](https://containerlab.dev/) | Build isolated container-based network topologies for configuration and failure experiments. | Advanced; public project documentation. Network OS images have separate access and licensing requirements; destroy lab topologies and inspect retained files afterward. |
| [Grafana k6](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/) | Evaluate programmable load and performance testing. | Intermediate; model real traffic and service objectives. External targets need explicit test authorization. |
| [Locust](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/) | Assess Python-based load modeling and distributed test execution. | Intermediate; confirm the documentation release, because moving branches can expose development builds. Workload design and load-generator limits affect conclusions. |
| [iperf3 documentation](https://software.es.net/iperf/) | Generate controlled throughput measurements between authorized network endpoints. | Intermediate; public project documentation. Traffic can saturate a path; coordinate endpoints and stop servers and tests afterward. |
| [Wireshark User's Guide](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/) | Inspect capture and protocol-analysis workflows for network diagnosis. | Intermediate; capture only with authorization. Traffic may contain sensitive data and encrypted payloads may remain unreadable. The linked manual currently displays development version 4.7.4; match the installed release. |

## Steady-state evidence

Measure useful service outcomes before, during, and after injection. Process health and a successful experiment job are not recovery evidence.

| --- | --- | --- |
| [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) | Evaluate metrics collection, querying, and monitoring architecture. | Intermediate; plan label cardinality, retention, storage, and availability. |
| [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) | Design alert grouping, routing, inhibition, and notification integration. | Intermediate; routing does not establish that an alert is actionable. Test ownership and delivery. |
| [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/) | Build and govern dashboards and documented observability integrations. | Intermediate; distinguish the operated software from cloud services and edition-specific capabilities. |
| [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) | Plan instrumentation, telemetry collection, and export across system components. | Intermediate; select signal pipelines and backends deliberately. Review data sensitivity and collector capacity. |
| [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/) | Review distributed tracing components and deployment guidance. | Intermediate; instrumentation coverage and sampling affect what can be observed. |
| [Grafana Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/) | Evaluate log aggregation, storage, queries, and deployment approaches. | Advanced; ingestion volume, label design, retention, and tenancy affect cost and performance. |
| [Prometheus Blackbox Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter) | Probe selected network and service endpoints from an external observation point. | Intermediate; public project repository. Probe location, credentials, and traffic volume change what results mean. |
| [Sloth](https://sloth.dev/) | Compare an SLO-to-Prometheus rule generator for service monitoring workflows. | Intermediate; public project documentation. Correct generated rules still require valid indicators and label boundaries. |
| [Pyrra](https://github.com/pyrra-dev/pyrra) | Evaluate SLO definition and visualization tooling around Prometheus-based measurements. | Intermediate; public project repository. Review deployment requirements and the service's actual measurement coverage. |

## Practice environments, delivery, and recovery

Use isolated deployment and recovery paths to make an experiment repeatable. Keep control over test data and retained resources.

| [kind quick start](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) | Create a local Kubernetes environment for manifest and controller experiments. | Intermediate; requires a supported container environment. Review host capacity and cluster deletion instructions. |

| [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs) | Assess declarative provisioning, providers, state, and reusable configuration. | Intermediate; review backend protection and provider behavior. Product edition and license terms need separate review. |
| [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/) | Evaluate declarative infrastructure provisioning and its documented state and workflow features. | Intermediate; verify provider, module, and state compatibility for your migration instead of assuming interchangeability. |
