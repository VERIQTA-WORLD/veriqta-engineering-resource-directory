# Scalability engineer

[SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

Resources for increasing useful system capacity as demand, data volume, tenants, or geographic scope grow. The collection connects workload models, load distribution, storage and state design, autoscaling, overload protection, profiling, and evidence that added capacity improves the intended outcome.

## Find a resource

Use the collections below for the task in front of you. Compare purpose, prerequisites, deployment model, and operating limitations before choosing a tool or applying a guide. The tools are alternatives or complementary components, not a required stack.

## Resource collections

| Collection | What you will find |
| --- | --- |
| [Tool directory](toolkit.md) | Tools grouped by implementation or operating task, with alternatives and selection notes. |
| [Official documentation](official-documentation.md) | Authoritative manuals, API references, and focused operating guides. |
| [Reference architectures and design guidance](reference-architectures.md) | Documented designs, patterns, assumptions, and decision resources. |
| [Learning resources](learning-resources.md) | Books, tutorials, research, talks, and discovery collections by topic. |
| [Labs, examples, and projects](labs-and-projects.md) | Practice environments, examples, workshops, and implementation repositories. |
| [Production responsibilities and operational resources](production-responsibilities.md) | Operating concerns connected to diagnostic, incident, and recovery resources. |
| [Standards and frameworks](standards-and-frameworks.md) | Specifications, security guidance, and review frameworks with scope distinctions. |
| [Related careers](related-careers.md) | Adjacent collections, their overlap, and their development status. |

## Useful starting points

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Non-abstract large system design](https://sre.google/workbook/non-abstract-design/) | Connect system design to concrete capacity, dependency, and failure assumptions. | Advanced; public workbook chapter. Recalculate workload assumptions rather than reusing example capacity figures. |
| [The USE method](https://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html) | Organize resource analysis around utilization, saturation, and errors. | Intermediate; public author reference. High utilization alone does not establish the limiting resource. |
| [k6 arrival-rate executors](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/scenarios/concepts/arrival-rate-vu-allocation/) | Understand workload generation and virtual-user allocation for arrival-rate tests. | Intermediate; public reference. Generator capacity and dropped iterations can distort the apparent system limit. |
| [Distributed consensus for reliability](https://sre.google/sre-book/managing-critical-state/) | Study critical state, consensus, and the operational consequences of distributed coordination. | Advanced; public chapter. Quorum assumptions differ from ordinary replica-count assumptions. |
| [Kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) | Study metric-based workload scaling and controller behavior. | Intermediate; public reference. Scaling replicas does not necessarily resolve a dependency bottleneck or supply node capacity. |

## Coverage

- Workload and growth models.
- Scaling bottlenecks and profiling.
- Load distribution and placement.
- State, partitions and coordination.
- Elasticity and generator validity.
- Overload and failure capacity.
- Economic and operational limits.

## Reading and access

Foundation material assumes limited topic experience; intermediate material usually assumes basic implementation knowledge; advanced material often assumes practical systems or production experience. Each entry narrows those expectations where needed. Publicly readable instructions do not make a hosted service, commercial book, software license, or cloud experiment free.

Resource descriptions and destinations were reviewed on **5 October 2026**. Version, preview, development, and historical notes identify material that needs particular care. The linked manuals and collections are not claimed to have been read or tested in full. External links are used while repository resource IDs and canonical mappings remain unassigned.
