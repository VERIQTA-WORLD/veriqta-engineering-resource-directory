# Scalability engineer: related careers

[Career overview](README.md) · [SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

These collections overlap in reliability concerns but emphasize different engineering boundaries. Role ownership varies by organization; use the scope descriptions to find the resources you need.

## Adjacent resource collections

| Career | Distinct emphasis and overlap | Collection status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Capacity engineer](../capacity-engineer/README.md) | Resources for measuring demand, identifying bottlenecks, forecasting resource needs, and validating the capacity available during normal operation and failures. | Included in this folder. |
| [Database reliability engineer](../database-reliability-engineer/README.md) | Resources for database availability, correctness, durability, query performance, replication, maintenance, backup, and recovery. | Included in this folder. |
| [Network reliability engineer](../network-reliability-engineer/README.md) | Resources for reliable connectivity, routing, DNS, traffic distribution, service discovery, and network-dependent application behavior. | Included in this folder. |
| [Service reliability engineer](../service-reliability-engineer/README.md) | Resources for operating an individual service or connected service boundary: user-facing outcomes, dependencies, latency, correctness, change safety, capacity, and recovery. | Included in this folder. |
| [Cloud reliability engineer](../cloud-reliability-engineer/README.md) | Resources for operating reliable cloud workloads across provider health, service limits, identity, networking, scaling, deployment, persistent data, and regional recovery. | Included in this folder. |

## Shared references

These direct references remain useful when moving between the adjacent collections. Their inclusion does not make the roles interchangeable.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Non-abstract large system design](https://sre.google/workbook/non-abstract-design/) | Connect system design to concrete capacity, dependency, and failure assumptions. | Advanced; public workbook chapter. Recalculate workload assumptions rather than reusing example capacity figures. |
| [The USE method](https://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html) | Organize resource analysis around utilization, saturation, and errors. | Intermediate; public author reference. High utilization alone does not establish the limiting resource. |
| [k6 arrival-rate executors](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/scenarios/concepts/arrival-rate-vu-allocation/) | Understand workload generation and virtual-user allocation for arrival-rate tests. | Intermediate; public reference. Generator capacity and dropped iterations can distort the apparent system limit. |
| [Distributed consensus for reliability](https://sre.google/sre-book/managing-critical-state/) | Study critical state, consensus, and the operational consequences of distributed coordination. | Advanced; public chapter. Quorum assumptions differ from ordinary replica-count assumptions. |
| [Kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) | Study metric-based workload scaling and controller behavior. | Intermediate; public reference. Scaling replicas does not necessarily resolve a dependency bottleneck or supply node capacity. |
