# Scalability engineer: reference architectures and design guidance

[Career overview](README.md) · [SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

Use these designs, patterns, and engineering accounts to test assumptions and compare alternatives. Provider blueprints, project guides, community principles, and formal specifications have different scopes.

## Design around the real workload

Study load distribution, overload behavior, and failure headroom. State which resources or dependencies remain shared as capacity expands.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Non-abstract large system design](https://sre.google/workbook/non-abstract-design/) | Connect system design to concrete capacity, dependency, and failure assumptions. | Advanced; public workbook chapter. Recalculate workload assumptions rather than reusing example capacity figures. |
| [Load balancing at the frontend](https://sre.google/sre-book/load-balancing-frontend/) | Explore traffic distribution and frontend reliability across infrastructure boundaries. | Advanced; public chapter. Provider and network topology determine which mechanisms are available. |
| [Load balancing in the datacenter](https://sre.google/sre-book/load-balancing-datacenter/) | Compare service load-balancing behavior, health signals, and backend selection. | Advanced; public chapter. A healthy endpoint may still be unable to satisfy the requested operation. |
| [Google SRE: handling overload](https://sre.google/sre-book/handling-overload/) | Study admission control, throttling, and overload behavior before increasing concurrency or capacity. | Intermediate; public book chapter. Google's implementations illustrate mechanisms, not settings to copy unchanged. |
| [Google SRE Workbook: managing load](https://sre.google/workbook/managing-load/) | Connect load balancing, overload management, and failure handling to service behavior. | Intermediate; public chapter. Adapt the examples to local traffic, dependencies, and recovery constraints. |
| [AWS Builders' Library: static stability](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/static-stability-using-availability-zones/) | Review designs that retain useful capacity during failures without depending on immediate expansion. | Advanced; public engineering article. AWS examples require workload-specific capacity and dependency analysis. |
| [AWS Builders' Library: workload isolation](https://d1.awsstatic.com/builderslibrary/pdfs/workload-isolation-using-shuffle-sharding.pdf) | Explore isolation patterns for limiting correlated impact across tenants and workloads. | Advanced; public original engineering article in PDF. Historical design account; adapt failure domains and assumptions to the actual workload. |

## State, partitions, and distributed work

Examine coordination and data-integrity requirements before moving to additional nodes or partitions. Distribution changes failure and recovery behavior as well as capacity.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Distributed consensus for reliability](https://sre.google/sre-book/managing-critical-state/) | Study critical state, consensus, and the operational consequences of distributed coordination. | Advanced; public chapter. Quorum assumptions differ from ordinary replica-count assumptions. |
| [Data integrity: what you read is what you wrote](https://sre.google/sre-book/data-integrity/) | Investigate durability, corruption detection, and integrity as distinct reliability concerns. | Advanced; public chapter. Replication and availability do not prove correct data or successful recovery. |
| [Data processing pipelines](https://sre.google/workbook/data-processing/) | Study reliability concerns in scheduled and streaming processing, including timeliness and completion. | Intermediate to advanced; public chapter. User-facing correctness and freshness may matter more than process uptime. |
| [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) | Find the author's book information and supporting resources for data-system design. | Intermediate to advanced; public book website. Full books are separate purchases; choose an edition and check publication details. |
| [PostgreSQL high availability and replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/high-availability.html) | Compare replication and standby arrangements, failure behavior, and responsibility boundaries. | Advanced; public reference. Replication lag, failover fencing, and application reconnection affect actual availability. |
| [Azure deployment stamps pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/deployment-stamp) | Compare independently deployable workload units and their failure boundaries. | Advanced; public pattern. Routing, data ownership, and stamp-level capacity affect recovery and operational complexity. |
| [Azure bulkhead pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/bulkhead) | Explore resource isolation between workloads and dependency paths. | Intermediate; public pattern. Isolation adds capacity and routing decisions; test the boundaries actually enforced. |

## Provider designs and scaling decisions

Use blueprints and frameworks to compare deployment boundaries and options. Record workload assumptions, measured limits, cost, and migration consequences.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AWS Architecture Center](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/) | Discover architecture guidance and reference material by workload and concern. | Intermediate to advanced; evaluate publication scope and required AWS services. |
| [Azure Architecture Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/) | Compare reference architectures, patterns, and decision guidance. | Intermediate to advanced; implementation choices and estimates require workload-specific validation. |
| [Google Cloud Architecture Center](https://cloud.google.com/architecture) | Find architecture guides and implementation references for Google Cloud. | Intermediate to advanced; filter by your workload and operational constraints. |
| [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html) | Review workload decisions across operational, reliability, security, performance, cost, and sustainability concerns. | Intermediate to advanced; AWS-specific guidance. Adapt recommendations to requirements. |
| [Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/) | Review Azure workload architecture and quality trade-offs. | Intermediate to advanced; assess workload context rather than treating guidance as a universal checklist. |
| [Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework) | Review Google Cloud architecture guidance across its documented pillars. | Intermediate to advanced; provider-specific capabilities and assumptions need review. |
| [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) | Describe software systems at useful levels of architectural abstraction. | Foundation onward; diagrams communicate structure but do not establish operational correctness. |
| [Architecture Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/) | Find guidance and resources for recording architectural decisions. | Foundation onward; keep decisions connected to evidence and later changes. |
| [FinOps Framework](https://www.finops.org/framework/) | Organize cost accountability, allocation, forecasting, and optimization work. | Intermediate; a practice framework, not a tool or a guarantee of savings. |
