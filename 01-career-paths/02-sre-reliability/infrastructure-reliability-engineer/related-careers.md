# Infrastructure reliability engineer: related careers

[Career overview](README.md) · [SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

These collections overlap in reliability concerns but emphasize different engineering boundaries. Role ownership varies by organization; use the scope descriptions to find the resources you need.

## Adjacent resource collections

| Career | Distinct emphasis and overlap | Collection status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Capacity engineer](../capacity-engineer/README.md) | Resources for measuring demand, identifying bottlenecks, forecasting resource needs, and validating the capacity available during normal operation and failures. | Included in this folder. |
| [Network reliability engineer](../network-reliability-engineer/README.md) | Resources for reliable connectivity, routing, DNS, traffic distribution, service discovery, and network-dependent application behavior. | Included in this folder. |
| [Cloud reliability engineer](../cloud-reliability-engineer/README.md) | Resources for operating reliable cloud workloads across provider health, service limits, identity, networking, scaling, deployment, persistent data, and regional recovery. | Included in this folder. |
| [Platform reliability engineer](../platform-reliability-engineer/README.md) | Resources for keeping shared developer and runtime platforms dependable: provisioning, reconciliation, build and delivery services, artifact distribution, identity, telemetry, and recovery. | Included in this folder. |
| [Database reliability engineer](../database-reliability-engineer/README.md) | Resources for database availability, correctness, durability, query performance, replication, maintenance, backup, and recovery. | Included in this folder. |

## Shared references

These direct references remain useful when moving between the adjacent collections. Their inclusion does not make the roles interchangeable.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [The USE method](https://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html) | Organize resource analysis around utilization, saturation, and errors. | Intermediate; public author reference. High utilization alone does not establish the limiting resource. |
| [Terraform backends](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend) | Compare state-backend configuration and documented backend capabilities. | Intermediate; locking and authentication differ by backend. Do not assume all backends behave alike. |
| [Operating etcd for Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/) | Find etcd configuration, maintenance, and recovery guidance for self-managed control planes. | Advanced; public task guide. Quorum changes and restores affect cluster state; managed providers have separate responsibility boundaries. |
| [AWS Builders' Library: static stability](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/static-stability-using-availability-zones/) | Review designs that retain useful capacity during failures without depending on immediate expansion. | Advanced; public engineering article. AWS examples require workload-specific capacity and dependency analysis. |
| [Data integrity: what you read is what you wrote](https://sre.google/sre-book/data-integrity/) | Investigate durability, corruption detection, and integrity as distinct reliability concerns. | Advanced; public chapter. Replication and availability do not prove correct data or successful recovery. |
