# Infrastructure reliability engineer

[SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

Resources for reliability of compute, hosts, provisioning, storage, networking, and infrastructure control systems. The focus is useful capacity and recoverable state under hardware, configuration, node, network, and control-plane failures, including the evidence needed to maintain and restore infrastructure safely.

## Find a resource

Use the collections below for the task in front of you. Compare purpose, prerequisites, deployment model, and operating limitations before choosing a tool or applying a guide. The tools are alternatives or complementary components, not a required stack.

## Resource collections

| Collection | What you will find |
| --- | --- |
| [Tool directory](toolkit.md) | Tools grouped by implementation or operating task, with alternatives and selection notes. |
| [Official documentation](official-documentation.md) | Authoritative manuals, API references, and focused operating guides. |
| [Reference architectures and design guidance](reference-architectures.md) | Documented designs, patterns, assumptions, and decision resources. |
| [Learning resources](learning-resources.md) | Books, tutorials, research, talks, and discovery collections by topic. |
| [Labs, examples, and projects](labs-and-projects.md) | Practice environments, examples, workshops, and implementation repositories. |
| [Production responsibilities and operational resources](production-responsibilities.md) | Operating concerns connected to diagnostic, incident, and recovery resources. |
| [Standards and frameworks](standards-and-frameworks.md) | Specifications, security guidance, and review frameworks with scope distinctions. |
| [Related careers](related-careers.md) | Adjacent collections, their overlap, and their development status. |

## Useful starting points

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [The USE method](https://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html) | Organize resource analysis around utilization, saturation, and errors. | Intermediate; public author reference. High utilization alone does not establish the limiting resource. |
| [Terraform backends](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend) | Compare state-backend configuration and documented backend capabilities. | Intermediate; locking and authentication differ by backend. Do not assume all backends behave alike. |
| [Operating etcd for Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/) | Find etcd configuration, maintenance, and recovery guidance for self-managed control planes. | Advanced; public task guide. Quorum changes and restores affect cluster state; managed providers have separate responsibility boundaries. |
| [AWS Builders' Library: static stability](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/static-stability-using-availability-zones/) | Review designs that retain useful capacity during failures without depending on immediate expansion. | Advanced; public engineering article. AWS examples require workload-specific capacity and dependency analysis. |
| [Data integrity: what you read is what you wrote](https://sre.google/sre-book/data-integrity/) | Investigate durability, corruption detection, and integrity as distinct reliability concerns. | Advanced; public chapter. Replication and availability do not prove correct data or successful recovery. |

## Coverage

- Host and compute health.
- Resource saturation and capacity.
- Provisioning state and controlled change.
- Storage and control-plane recovery.
- Network and identity dependencies.
- Maintenance and failure-domain isolation.
- Infrastructure telemetry, objectives and cost.

## Reading and access

Foundation material assumes limited topic experience; intermediate material usually assumes basic implementation knowledge; advanced material often assumes practical systems or production experience. Each entry narrows those expectations where needed. Publicly readable instructions do not make a hosted service, commercial book, software license, or cloud experiment free.

Resource descriptions and destinations were reviewed on **5 October 2026**. Version, preview, development, and historical notes identify material that needs particular care. The linked manuals and collections are not claimed to have been read or tested in full. External links are used while repository resource IDs and canonical mappings remain unassigned.
