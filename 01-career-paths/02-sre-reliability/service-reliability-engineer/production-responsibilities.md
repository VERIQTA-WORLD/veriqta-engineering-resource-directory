## Maintain a service operating agreement

Record user journeys, objectives, owners, dependency boundaries, release authority, escalation, and recovery expectations. Keep the agreement usable during an incident.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Implementing SLOs](https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/) | Review practical service-level objective design and adoption. | Intermediate; useful measures depend on service behavior and user expectations. |
| [Example SLO document](https://sre.google/workbook/slo-document/) | Review a worked document connecting service indicators, targets, and measurement details. | Foundation onward; public appendix. Adapt the scope and data sources instead of copying its numbers. |
| [Example error budget policy](https://sre.google/workbook/error-budget-policy/) | Find a concrete example of how reliability evidence can influence change decisions. | Intermediate; public appendix. A policy needs agreed authority, exceptions, and a measured service boundary. |
| [The evolving SRE engagement model](https://sre.google/workbook/engagement-model/) | Understand service engagement, collaboration, and operational responsibility boundaries. | Intermediate; public workbook chapter. Organizational labels and staffing models vary; explicitly agree ownership locally. |
| [Reliable product launches](https://sre.google/sre-book/reliable-product-launches/) | Compare readiness review, launch coordination, and production-risk reduction. | Intermediate; public book chapter. Select checks appropriate to the service and the people who own it. |
| [Being on-call](https://sre.google/sre-book/being-on-call/) | Review escalation, operating preparedness, and the human responsibilities of incident coverage. | Foundation onward; public chapter. Staffing and escalation arrangements must be agreed locally. |

## Make signals actionable and investigate symptoms

Check data quality, alert thresholds, routing, and missing signals. Correlate metrics, traces, logs, database behavior, and network evidence.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Alerting on SLOs](https://sre.google/workbook/alerting-on-slos/) | Compare alerting approaches based on reliability objectives and budget consumption. | Advanced; validate alert behavior against real traffic and responder capacity. |
| [Prometheus querying basics](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) | Read query semantics before interpreting rates, ranges, and label-based aggregation. | Intermediate; public reference. Queries can omit traffic or combine unrelated services if labels are wrong. |
| [Prometheus rule unit tests](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/unit_testing_rules/) | Test rule behavior against synthetic time-series inputs before changing production alerts. | Intermediate; public practical reference. Synthetic series do not establish live scrape or routing correctness. |
| [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) | Review telemetry reception, processing, export, and deployment concerns. | Intermediate; size for throughput and failure conditions and evaluate sensitive-data handling. |
| [Effective troubleshooting](https://sre.google/sre-book/effective-troubleshooting/) | Use hypotheses and evidence to narrow a production failure rather than change unrelated settings. | Foundation onward; public chapter. Its method complements product-specific diagnostic references. |
| [PostgreSQL statistics and activity](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html) | Investigate sessions, activity, waits, and collected database statistics. | Intermediate; public reference. Visibility permissions and collection timing affect what you can conclude. |
| [PostgreSQL explicit locking](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html) | Understand lock conflicts and deadlock behavior before intervening in blocked database work. | Intermediate; public reference. Terminating a session can abort transactions and affect application behavior. |
| [Wireshark user guide](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/) | Review capture setup, protocol analysis, display filtering, and packet inspection workflows. | Foundation to advanced; public manual currently displaying development version 4.7.4. Match the installed release; packet capture requires permission and careful handling of sensitive data. |

## Validate release, overload, and dependency behavior

Evaluate user outcomes after changes and under the defined failure and load conditions. Check retry amplification, data correctness, and useful recovery capacity.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Canarying releases](https://sre.google/workbook/canarying-releases/) | Review candidate evaluation, rollout design, and the limits of release signals. | Advanced; comparison quality and observation design determine whether a canary is informative. |
| [Ensuring rollback safety during deployments](https://d1.awsstatic.com/builderslibrary/pdfs/ensuring-rollback-safety-during-deployments.pdf) | Review compatibility and recovery concerns when versions coexist or change. | Advanced; official PDF. Application and schema compatibility must be tested in your own system. |
| [Testing for reliability](https://sre.google/sre-book/testing-reliability/) | Compare test types and their relationship to failure detection and operational confidence. | Intermediate; public chapter. A passing test covers its scenarios, not every failure mode. |
| [k6 thresholds](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/thresholds/) | Define explicit load-test acceptance conditions rather than relying on a completed run. | Intermediate; public reference. Thresholds need a justified target, representative workload, and sufficient observations. |
| [Google SRE: handling overload](https://sre.google/sre-book/handling-overload/) | Study admission control, throttling, and overload behavior before increasing concurrency or capacity. | Intermediate; public book chapter. Google's implementations illustrate mechanisms, not settings to copy unchanged. |
| [Timeouts, retries, and backoff with jitter](https://d1.awsstatic.com/builderslibrary/pdfs/timeouts-retries-and-backoff-with-jitter.pdf) | Review dependency-call behavior and retry amplification risks. | Advanced; official PDF. Values require latency and failure evidence from your own system. |
| [Making retries safe with idempotent APIs](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/making-retries-safe-with-idempotent-APIs/) | Study duplicate-request handling and API design trade-offs. | Advanced; operation semantics determine which retry behavior is safe. |
| [Data integrity: what you read is what you wrote](https://sre.google/sre-book/data-integrity/) | Investigate durability, corruption detection, and integrity as distinct reliability concerns. | Advanced; public chapter. Replication and availability do not prove correct data or successful recovery. |

## Respond, restore, and reduce recurring work

Coordinate incident response, measure restoration, and keep follow-up work connected to owners and verification. Review toil and provider incidents without transferring their assumptions blindly.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Managing incidents](https://sre.google/sre-book/managing-incidents/) | Review incident roles, coordination, communication, and operational response. | Intermediate; adapt role separation to team size and actual on-call arrangements. |

| [PostgreSQL backup and restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup.html) | Review database backup approaches and their operational implications. | Advanced; use documentation matching the deployed database version and test restored data. |
| [pgBackRest command reference](https://pgbackrest.org/command.html) | Check command options for controlled backup and restore experiments. | Advanced; public CLI reference. Restore operations can replace database files; use an isolated target and retire only designated test storage, preserving required source backups. |
| [Eliminating toil](https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/) | Distinguish repeated operational work from engineering improvements when selecting automation. | Foundation onward; public book chapter. The examples describe Google's context; measure local effort and risk before transferring targets. |
| [The evolution of automation](https://sre.google/sre-book/automation-at-google/) | Study how automation changes operating practices and control boundaries. | Intermediate; public book chapter. Large-scale examples are design references, not a requirement to build an equivalent platform. |
| [Cloudflare outage of July 2, 2019](https://blog.cloudflare.com/details-of-the-cloudflare-outage-on-july-2-2019/) | Read the original account of a globally propagated service failure and its operating lessons. | Intermediate; public historical incident report. Retain the documented cause and timeline; it does not describe every later system version. |
| [GitHub October 2018 incident analysis](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/oct21-post-incident-analysis/) | Read the original incident analysis of database topology and recovery decisions. | Advanced; public historical report. Findings describe that incident and architecture, not a current service guarantee. |
| [GitLab database incident postmortem](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/) | Study operational mistakes, recovery dependencies, and backup-validation lessons in an original report. | Intermediate; public historical incident account. Do not confuse configured backup procedures with demonstrated restore capability. |
