# Cloud reliability engineer: reference architectures and design guidance

[Career overview](README.md) · [SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

Use these designs, patterns, and engineering accounts to test assumptions and compare alternatives. Provider blueprints, project guides, community principles, and formal specifications have different scopes.

## Cloud failure domains and foundations

State which zones, regions, identities, data paths, and shared dependencies can fail together. Compare the actual provider architecture and limits.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AWS Architecture Center](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/) | Discover architecture guidance and reference material by workload and concern. | Intermediate to advanced; evaluate publication scope and required AWS services. |
| [Azure Architecture Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/) | Compare reference architectures, patterns, and decision guidance. | Intermediate to advanced; implementation choices and estimates require workload-specific validation. |
| [Google Cloud Architecture Center](https://cloud.google.com/architecture) | Find architecture guides and implementation references for Google Cloud. | Intermediate to advanced; filter by your workload and operational constraints. |
| [AWS Builders' Library: static stability](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/static-stability-using-availability-zones/) | Review designs that retain useful capacity during failures without depending on immediate expansion. | Advanced; public engineering article. AWS examples require workload-specific capacity and dependency analysis. |
| [Amazon EKS best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/best-practices/introduction.html) | Review Kubernetes workload and cluster-design guidance for EKS. | Advanced; EKS-specific assumptions must be separated from general Kubernetes advice. |
| [AKS baseline architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks/baseline-aks) | Examine a documented infrastructure baseline for an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster. | Advanced; adapt identity, network, availability, and cost choices to requirements. |
| [Azure landing zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/) | Review enterprise-scale platform foundations and design areas. | Advanced; tailoring and operating ownership are required before deployment. |
| [Google Cloud enterprise foundations blueprint](https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/blueprints/security-foundations) | Review an opinionated approach to organizational cloud foundations. | Advanced; blueprint choices are assumptions to evaluate, not mandatory design decisions. |

## Recovery and degraded operation

Design for workload behavior during dependency failure as well as restart. Compare retry, isolation, and circuit-breaking against the service time budget.

| [AWS disaster recovery guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws.html) | Compare recovery strategies and resilience considerations for AWS workloads. | Advanced; define recovery time and recovery point objectives and test the complete workload. |
| [Azure reliability disaster-recovery guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/disaster-recovery-overview) | Locate Azure disaster-recovery concepts and planning guidance. | Advanced; service support and workload dependencies determine feasible recovery objectives. |
| [Google Cloud disaster recovery planning guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/dr-scenarios-planning-guide) | Review recovery planning, objectives, and scenario selection. | Advanced; test identity, configuration, data, and traffic restoration together. |
| [Timeouts, retries, and backoff with jitter](https://d1.awsstatic.com/builderslibrary/pdfs/timeouts-retries-and-backoff-with-jitter.pdf) | Review dependency-call behavior and retry amplification risks. | Advanced; official PDF. Values require latency and failure evidence from your own system. |
| [Making retries safe with idempotent APIs](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/making-retries-safe-with-idempotent-APIs/) | Study duplicate-request handling and API design trade-offs. | Advanced; operation semantics determine which retry behavior is safe. |
| [Azure circuit breaker pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker) | Compare dependency-failure containment and recovery-probe behavior. | Intermediate; public pattern. Thresholds and reset behavior must match the dependency and user impact. |
| [Azure bulkhead pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/bulkhead) | Explore resource isolation between workloads and dependency paths. | Intermediate; public pattern. Isolation adds capacity and routing decisions; test the boundaries actually enforced. |
| [Azure deployment stamps pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/deployment-stamp) | Compare independently deployable workload units and their failure boundaries. | Advanced; public pattern. Routing, data ownership, and stamp-level capacity affect recovery and operational complexity. |

## Reliability decisions and evidence

Document service objectives, recovery assumptions, capacity, ownership, and the evidence required to accept the design.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |

| [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) | Describe software systems at useful levels of architectural abstraction. | Foundation onward; diagrams communicate structure but do not establish operational correctness. |
| [Architecture Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/) | Find guidance and resources for recording architectural decisions. | Foundation onward; keep decisions connected to evidence and later changes. |
| [Implementing SLOs](https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/) | Review practical service-level objective design and adoption. | Intermediate; useful measures depend on service behavior and user expectations. |
| [SLO engineering case studies](https://sre.google/workbook/slo-engineering-case-studies/) | Compare service-objective decisions and measurement approaches in concrete cases. | Intermediate; public chapter. Keep the service boundary and user expectations explicit. |
| [Example error budget policy](https://sre.google/workbook/error-budget-policy/) | Find a concrete example of how reliability evidence can influence change decisions. | Intermediate; public appendix. A policy needs agreed authority, exceptions, and a measured service boundary. |
| [FinOps Framework](https://www.finops.org/framework/) | Organize cost accountability, allocation, forecasting, and optimization work. | Intermediate; a practice framework, not a tool or a guarantee of savings. |
