## Failure behavior and recovery reasoning

Read concrete mechanisms and operating experience before selecting a pattern. Separate recovery of service, data correctness, and restoration of full capacity.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Site Reliability Engineering](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/) | Read original material on service objectives, risk, toil, monitoring, and operational engineering. | Intermediate; openly readable. Translate examples to your team size and system constraints. |
| [The Site Reliability Workbook](https://sre.google/workbook/table-of-contents/) | Study implementation-oriented reliability practices and case studies. | Intermediate to advanced; openly readable. Requires familiarity with service operation. |
| [Building Secure and Reliable Systems](https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/toc.html) | Explore security and reliability together in system design and operations. | Advanced; openly readable. Examples require interpretation for your environment. |
| [Addressing cascading failures](https://sre.google/sre-book/addressing-cascading-failures/) | Review overload, feedback loops, and failure propagation. | Advanced; validate containment strategies with bounded tests and measurements. |
| [Google SRE: handling overload](https://sre.google/sre-book/handling-overload/) | Study admission control, throttling, and overload behavior before increasing concurrency or capacity. | Intermediate; public book chapter. Google's implementations illustrate mechanisms, not settings to copy unchanged. |
| [Data integrity: what you read is what you wrote](https://sre.google/sre-book/data-integrity/) | Investigate durability, corruption detection, and integrity as distinct reliability concerns. | Advanced; public chapter. Replication and availability do not prove correct data or successful recovery. |
| [Distributed consensus for reliability](https://sre.google/sre-book/managing-critical-state/) | Study critical state, consensus, and the operational consequences of distributed coordination. | Advanced; public chapter. Quorum assumptions differ from ordinary replica-count assumptions. |
| [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) | Find the author's book information and supporting resources for data-system design. | Intermediate to advanced; public book website. Full books are separate purchases; choose an edition and check publication details. |

## Experiments and implementation references

Use principles and project documentation to define the hypothesis, steady state, blast radius, and recovery checks.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Principles of Chaos Engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/) | Frame experiments around a steady-state hypothesis and measured failure behavior. | Intermediate; public community principles. They do not authorize production testing or guarantee an experiment's safety. |
| [Testing for reliability](https://sre.google/sre-book/testing-reliability/) | Compare test types and their relationship to failure detection and operational confidence. | Intermediate; public chapter. A passing test covers its scenarios, not every failure mode. |
| [Chaos Toolkit documentation](https://chaostoolkit.org/) | Explore experiment definitions, drivers, and execution guidance for hypothesis-based failure testing. | Advanced; public project documentation. Extensions need separate review; experiments can affect availability and data. |
| [Chaos Mesh documentation](https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/) | Find experiment types, scheduling, permissions, and fault-injection guidance. | Advanced; public project documentation. Cluster and node effects vary by experiment; define abort conditions and verify recovery. |
| [Toxiproxy](https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy) | Introduce controlled connection faults between a test client and service. | Intermediate; public project repository and examples. Confine the proxy to authorized test traffic and remove injected faults afterward. |
| [Cloud design patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/) | Compare patterns addressing distributed-system concerns and trade-offs. | Intermediate; examples are provider-oriented, while many problem statements apply more broadly. |

## Incident and restoration accounts

These historical accounts show particular failure mechanisms and recovery constraints. Extract questions for your own system rather than copy their architectures.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Cloudflare outage of July 2, 2019](https://blog.cloudflare.com/details-of-the-cloudflare-outage-on-july-2-2019/) | Read the original account of a globally propagated service failure and its operating lessons. | Intermediate; public historical incident report. Retain the documented cause and timeline; it does not describe every later system version. |
| [Cloudflare control-plane and analytics outage](https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-mortem-on-cloudflare-control-plane-and-analytics-outage/) | Compare dependency, datacenter, and recovery concerns in an original outage account. | Advanced; public historical postmortem. Distinguish affected control-plane and analytics functions from unaffected services. |
| [GitHub October 2018 incident analysis](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/oct21-post-incident-analysis/) | Read the original incident analysis of database topology and recovery decisions. | Advanced; public historical report. Findings describe that incident and architecture, not a current service guarantee. |
| [GitLab database incident postmortem](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/) | Study operational mistakes, recovery dependencies, and backup-validation lessons in an original report. | Intermediate; public historical incident account. Do not confuse configured backup procedures with demonstrated restore capability. |
| [AWS S3 service disruption summary, 2017](https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/) | Read the provider's original account of a historical regional service disruption. | Intermediate; public historical report. Its documented scope and corrective actions are specific to that event. |
| [Postmortem culture](https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/) | Review incident learning, documentation, and follow-up practices. | Intermediate; focus on evidenced contributing factors and actionable improvement. |
| [Managing incidents](https://sre.google/sre-book/managing-incidents/) | Review incident roles, coordination, communication, and operational response. | Intermediate; adapt role separation to team size and actual on-call arrangements. |
