## Maintain explicit recovery assumptions

Record service scope, failure domains, recovery objectives, dependencies, data protection, authority, and owners. Keep design records aligned with the implemented environment.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AWS disaster recovery guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws.html) | Compare recovery strategies and resilience considerations for AWS workloads. | Advanced; define recovery time and recovery point objectives and test the complete workload. |
| [Azure reliability disaster-recovery guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/disaster-recovery-overview) | Locate Azure disaster-recovery concepts and planning guidance. | Advanced; service support and workload dependencies determine feasible recovery objectives. |
| [Google Cloud disaster recovery planning guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/dr-scenarios-planning-guide) | Review recovery planning, objectives, and scenario selection. | Advanced; test identity, configuration, data, and traffic restoration together. |
| [Data integrity: what you read is what you wrote](https://sre.google/sre-book/data-integrity/) | Investigate durability, corruption detection, and integrity as distinct reliability concerns. | Advanced; public chapter. Replication and availability do not prove correct data or successful recovery. |
| [Architecture Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/) | Find guidance and resources for recording architectural decisions. | Foundation onward; keep decisions connected to evidence and later changes. |
| [Example SLO document](https://sre.google/workbook/slo-document/) | Review a worked document connecting service indicators, targets, and measurement details. | Foundation onward; public appendix. Adapt the scope and data sources instead of copying its numbers. |

## Validate isolation and degraded operation

Check useful service under dependency loss, capacity loss, and retry pressure. Observe whether the intended containment boundary holds.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AWS Builders' Library: static stability](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/static-stability-using-availability-zones/) | Review designs that retain useful capacity during failures without depending on immediate expansion. | Advanced; public engineering article. AWS examples require workload-specific capacity and dependency analysis. |
| [AWS Builders' Library: workload isolation](https://d1.awsstatic.com/builderslibrary/pdfs/workload-isolation-using-shuffle-sharding.pdf) | Explore isolation patterns for limiting correlated impact across tenants and workloads. | Advanced; public original engineering article in PDF. Historical design account; adapt failure domains and assumptions to the actual workload. |
| [Azure bulkhead pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/bulkhead) | Explore resource isolation between workloads and dependency paths. | Intermediate; public pattern. Isolation adds capacity and routing decisions; test the boundaries actually enforced. |
| [Azure circuit breaker pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker) | Compare dependency-failure containment and recovery-probe behavior. | Intermediate; public pattern. Thresholds and reset behavior must match the dependency and user impact. |
| [Google SRE: handling overload](https://sre.google/sre-book/handling-overload/) | Study admission control, throttling, and overload behavior before increasing concurrency or capacity. | Intermediate; public book chapter. Google's implementations illustrate mechanisms, not settings to copy unchanged. |
| [Timeouts, retries, and backoff with jitter](https://d1.awsstatic.com/builderslibrary/pdfs/timeouts-retries-and-backoff-with-jitter.pdf) | Review dependency-call behavior and retry amplification risks. | Advanced; official PDF. Values require latency and failure evidence from your own system. |
| [k6 thresholds](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/thresholds/) | Define explicit load-test acceptance conditions rather than relying on a completed run. | Intermediate; public reference. Thresholds need a justified target, representative workload, and sufficient observations. |

## Exercise restoration and failover

Measure restored service and data outcomes, including access and infrastructure dependencies. Use controlled experiments to expose unavailable or incomplete recovery material.

| --- | --- | --- |
| [pgBackRest command reference](https://pgbackrest.org/command.html) | Check command options for controlled backup and restore experiments. | Advanced; public CLI reference. Restore operations can replace database files; use an isolated target and retire only designated test storage, preserving required source backups. |
| [PostgreSQL backup and restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup.html) | Review database backup approaches and their operational implications. | Advanced; use documentation matching the deployed database version and test restored data. |
| [PostgreSQL high availability and replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/high-availability.html) | Compare replication and standby arrangements, failure behavior, and responsibility boundaries. | Advanced; public reference. Replication lag, failover fencing, and application reconnection affect actual availability. |
| [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel/) | Review Redis monitoring and failover coordination in the documented Sentinel model. | Advanced; public reference. Clients, quorum arrangements, and network partitions affect failover outcomes. |
| [Testing for reliability](https://sre.google/sre-book/testing-reliability/) | Compare test types and their relationship to failure detection and operational confidence. | Intermediate; public chapter. A passing test covers its scenarios, not every failure mode. |
| [Principles of Chaos Engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/) | Frame experiments around a steady-state hypothesis and measured failure behavior. | Intermediate; public community principles. They do not authorize production testing or guarantee an experiment's safety. |

## Coordinate disruption and improve from incidents

Use provider status alongside your own telemetry and incident coordination. Turn discovered recovery gaps into owned work with a verification check.

| [GitLab database incident postmortem](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/) | Study operational mistakes, recovery dependencies, and backup-validation lessons in an original report. | Intermediate; public historical incident account. Do not confuse configured backup procedures with demonstrated restore capability. |
| [AWS S3 service disruption summary, 2017](https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/) | Read the provider's original account of a historical regional service disruption. | Intermediate; public historical report. Its documented scope and corrective actions are specific to that event. |

## Maintain response coordination and escalation
