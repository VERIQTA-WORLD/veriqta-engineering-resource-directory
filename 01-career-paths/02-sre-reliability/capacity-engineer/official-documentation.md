# Capacity engineer: official documentation

[Career overview](README.md) · [SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

Use these primary references to check implementation details and operating behavior. Select documentation matching your installed versions and provider; a latest-version URL can change over time.

## Workload generation and acceptance

Check workload semantics and acceptance criteria before interpreting a test result. A generator that cannot maintain its requested load can hide the service limit.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [k6 thresholds](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/thresholds/) | Define explicit load-test acceptance conditions rather than relying on a completed run. | Intermediate; public reference. Thresholds need a justified target, representative workload, and sufficient observations. |
| [k6 arrival-rate executors](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/scenarios/concepts/arrival-rate-vu-allocation/) | Understand workload generation and virtual-user allocation for arrival-rate tests. | Intermediate; public reference. Generator capacity and dropped iterations can distort the apparent system limit. |
| [Locust quick start](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/quickstart.html) | Practice a Python-defined load test using project-maintained setup instructions. | Intermediate; public quick-start guide. The stable URL currently serves a development build; select documentation matching the installed Locust version and use authorized targets. |
| [PostgreSQL pgbench](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgbench.html) | Explore database workload generation and benchmark interpretation in a disposable database. | Intermediate; public CLI guide. Initialization and workloads modify data and can saturate the server; remove the test database when finished. |
| [fio documentation](https://fio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | Design controlled storage workload tests and interpret latency and throughput reports. | Advanced; public workload-generator manual currently built from a development revision. Use version-matched options and disposable test files; raw-device jobs can destroy data. |
| [iperf3 documentation](https://software.es.net/iperf/) | Generate controlled throughput measurements between authorized network endpoints. | Intermediate; public project documentation. Traffic can saturate a path; coordinate endpoints and stop servers and tests afterward. |

## Resource and scaling behavior

Review the actual scheduling and resource-control layer. Autoscaling needs both a signal and capacity that can be supplied within the service time budget.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Container resource management](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) | Review requests, limits, scheduling, and resource constraints. | Intermediate; workload measurements and node capacity are needed for useful settings. |
| [Kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) | Study metric-based workload scaling and controller behavior. | Intermediate; public reference. Scaling replicas does not necessarily resolve a dependency bottleneck or supply node capacity. |
| [Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler) | Review resource recommendation and adjustment workflows for Kubernetes workloads. | Advanced; public project repository. Resource updates can affect scheduling and availability; check the selected update mode. |
| [Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler) | Review node-capacity scaling and provider integration constraints. | Advanced; public project repository. Provider quotas, node-group limits, and workload scheduling constraints affect expansion. |
| [Karpenter documentation](https://karpenter.sh/docs/) | Compare node provisioning and disruption behavior for supported Kubernetes environments. | Advanced; public project documentation. Provider compatibility, IAM permissions, quotas, and replacement effects require review. |
| [Linux control group v2 documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html) | Understand hierarchical host resource control and interactions with service managers and container runtimes. | Advanced; public kernel reference tracking a development kernel at review time. Match the deployed kernel and verify cgroup mode and delegated permissions before experiments. |
| [AWS Service Quotas documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/) | Investigate account and service limits that can block provisioning or scaling. | Intermediate; public documentation. Quota increases are not guaranteed and may not resolve regional resource scarcity. |
| [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html) | Review instance-group scaling, health, and fleet operating behavior. | Intermediate; public reference. Scaling policies need capacity, permissions, startup time, and cost review. |
| [Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/) | Find fleet scaling, configuration, upgrade, and operations guidance. | Intermediate; public reference collection. Check orchestration mode and the deployed image and service versions. |
| [Google Cloud managed instance groups](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups) | Review VM group management, health, and scaling guidance. | Intermediate; public reference. Regional capacity, quotas, startup time, and managed-group configuration affect outcomes. |

## Measurements and data bottlenecks

Evaluate aggregation, collection cost, and missing signals. Database waits, locks, and plans can explain latency despite apparently available application capacity.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Prometheus querying basics](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) | Read query semantics before interpreting rates, ranges, and label-based aggregation. | Intermediate; public reference. Queries can omit traffic or combine unrelated services if labels are wrong. |
| [Prometheus recording rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/) | Plan reusable query results and rule evaluation for operational dashboards and alerts. | Intermediate; public reference. Rule evaluation load and failure visibility require operational review. |
| [Prometheus instrumentation practices](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/instrumentation/) | Select metrics and labels that answer operating questions without uncontrolled cardinality. | Intermediate; public guide. Instrumentation overhead and confidential label values need review. |
| [Prometheus storage](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/) | Review retention, local storage, and durability considerations for metrics infrastructure. | Advanced; public reference. Persistent storage is not a substitute for monitoring continuity or an exercised restore. |
| [PostgreSQL statistics and activity](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html) | Investigate sessions, activity, waits, and collected database statistics. | Intermediate; public reference. Visibility permissions and collection timing affect what you can conclude. |
| [PostgreSQL explicit locking](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html) | Understand lock conflicts and deadlock behavior before intervening in blocked database work. | Intermediate; public reference. Terminating a session can abort transactions and affect application behavior. |
| [PostgreSQL EXPLAIN guidance](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html) | Read execution plans and investigate query behavior with documented planner concepts. | Intermediate; public guide. EXPLAIN ANALYZE executes the query; use controlled targets for statements with side effects. |
| [MySQL Performance Schema](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/performance-schema.html) | Investigate instrumented database execution and resource use through the supported diagnostic system. | Advanced; public version-specific reference. Instrumentation, privileges, and overhead need review. |
| [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) | Review telemetry reception, processing, export, and deployment concerns. | Intermediate; size for throughput and failure conditions and evaluate sensitive-data handling. |
