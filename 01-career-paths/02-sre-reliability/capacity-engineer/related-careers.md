# Capacity engineer: related careers

[Career overview](README.md) · [SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

These collections overlap in reliability concerns but emphasize different engineering boundaries. Role ownership varies by organization; use the scope descriptions to find the resources you need.

## Adjacent resource collections

| Career | Distinct emphasis and overlap | Collection status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Scalability engineer](../scalability-engineer/README.md) | Resources for increasing useful system capacity as demand, data volume, tenants, or geographic scope grow. | Included in this folder. |
| [Performance engineer](https://github.com/VERIQTA-WORLD/veriqta-engineering-resource-directory/blob/main/01-career-paths/09-observability-performance/performance-engineer/README.md) | Performance analysis, profiling, workload behavior, and bottleneck investigation; useful when reliability work requires deeper performance diagnosis. | Existing repository path; collection still being developed. |
| [Infrastructure reliability engineer](../infrastructure-reliability-engineer/README.md) | Resources for reliability of compute, hosts, provisioning, storage, networking, and infrastructure control systems. | Included in this folder. |
| [Cloud reliability engineer](../cloud-reliability-engineer/README.md) | Resources for operating reliable cloud workloads across provider health, service limits, identity, networking, scaling, deployment, persistent data, and regional recovery. | Included in this folder. |
| [Database reliability engineer](../database-reliability-engineer/README.md) | Resources for database availability, correctness, durability, query performance, replication, maintenance, backup, and recovery. | Included in this folder. |

## Shared references

These direct references remain useful when moving between the adjacent collections. Their inclusion does not make the roles interchangeable.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [The USE method](https://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html) | Organize resource analysis around utilization, saturation, and errors. | Intermediate; public author reference. High utilization alone does not establish the limiting resource. |
| [Non-abstract large system design](https://sre.google/workbook/non-abstract-design/) | Connect system design to concrete capacity, dependency, and failure assumptions. | Advanced; public workbook chapter. Recalculate workload assumptions rather than reusing example capacity figures. |
| [Google SRE: handling overload](https://sre.google/sre-book/handling-overload/) | Study admission control, throttling, and overload behavior before increasing concurrency or capacity. | Intermediate; public book chapter. Google's implementations illustrate mechanisms, not settings to copy unchanged. |
| [k6 arrival-rate executors](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/scenarios/concepts/arrival-rate-vu-allocation/) | Understand workload generation and virtual-user allocation for arrival-rate tests. | Intermediate; public reference. Generator capacity and dropped iterations can distort the apparent system limit. |
| [AWS Service Quotas documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/) | Investigate account and service limits that can block provisioning or scaling. | Intermediate; public documentation. Quota increases are not guaranteed and may not resolve regional resource scarcity. |
