# Capacity engineer: standards and frameworks

[Career overview](README.md) · [SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

Distinguish normative specifications, security guidance, community principles, and vendor review frameworks. Read the source document and select the version applicable to the implementation; listing a framework does not establish compliance.

## Measurement and service-objective contracts

Use shared schemas and protocol references to make measurement definitions explicit. They do not validate a workload model or sampling design.

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [OpenSLO](https://openslo.com/) | Review a shared specification for expressing service-level objectives and related metadata. | Intermediate; public specification project. Implementation support and supported schema versions vary. |
| [IP performance metrics framework, RFC 2330](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2330.html) | Distinguish measurement definitions, samples, and network performance methodology. | Advanced; public foundational framework. Measurement location and sampling design affect interpretation. |
| [HTTP semantics, RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html) | Review method semantics, status codes, and HTTP behavior relevant to APIs and proxies. | Intermediate to advanced; protocol semantics do not define your application's retry or authorization policy. |
| [TCP specification, RFC 9293](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9293.html) | Review TCP transport semantics relevant to connection and retransmission investigations. | Advanced; public specification. The network path and application protocol add behavior beyond TCP. |

## Architecture and economic frameworks

Use these as review aids for the deployed provider and expenditure model, rather than certification or a universal capacity formula.

| --- | --- | --- |
| [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html) | Review AWS workload decisions and architectural trade-offs. | Intermediate to advanced; provider-specific framework, not an independent compliance audit. |
| [Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/) | Structure Azure workload reviews around documented quality concerns. | Intermediate to advanced; tailor review depth to business and workload needs. |
| [Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework) | Structure Google Cloud workload architecture reviews. | Intermediate to advanced; provider-specific assumptions require interpretation. |
| [FinOps Framework](https://www.finops.org/framework/) | Connect technology cost decisions with accountability and business value. | Intermediate; apply using actual operating and billing evidence. |
| [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) | Locate the framework and supporting security-risk-management resources. | Intermediate; framework use is not itself evidence of technical control effectiveness. |
