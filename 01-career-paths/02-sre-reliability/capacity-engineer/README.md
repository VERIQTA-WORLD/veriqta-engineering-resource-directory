# Capacity engineer

[SRE and reliability directory](../README.md)

Resources for measuring demand, identifying bottlenecks, forecasting resource needs, and validating the capacity available during normal operation and failures. The collection connects workload models to load generators, host and database diagnostics, autoscaling, provider limits, storage, network capacity, and cost.

## Find a resource

Use the collections below for the task in front of you. Compare purpose, prerequisites, deployment model, and operating limitations before choosing a tool or applying a guide. The tools are alternatives or complementary components, not a required stack.

## Resource collections

| Collection | What you will find |
| --- | --- |
| [Tool directory](toolkit.md) | Tools grouped by implementation or operating task, with alternatives and selection notes. |
| [Official documentation](official-documentation.md) | Authoritative manuals, API references, and focused operating guides. |
| [Reference architectures and design guidance](reference-architectures.md) | Documented designs, patterns, assumptions, and decision resources. |
| [Learning resources](learning-resources.md) | Books, tutorials, research, talks, and discovery collections by topic. |
| [Labs, examples, and projects](labs-and-projects.md) | Practice environments, examples, workshops, and implementation repositories. |
| [Production responsibilities and operational resources](production-responsibilities.md) | Operating concerns connected to diagnostic, incident, and recovery resources. |
| [Standards and frameworks](standards-and-frameworks.md) | Specifications, security guidance, and review frameworks with scope distinctions. |
| [Related careers](related-careers.md) | Adjacent collections, their overlap, and their development status. |

## Useful starting points

| Resource | What it helps with | Level, access, and selection notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [The USE method](https://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html) | Organize resource analysis around utilization, saturation, and errors. | Intermediate; public author reference. High utilization alone does not establish the limiting resource. |
| [Non-abstract large system design](https://sre.google/workbook/non-abstract-design/) | Connect system design to concrete capacity, dependency, and failure assumptions. | Advanced; public workbook chapter. Recalculate workload assumptions rather than reusing example capacity figures. |
| [Google SRE: handling overload](https://sre.google/sre-book/handling-overload/) | Study admission control, throttling, and overload behavior before increasing concurrency or capacity. | Intermediate; public book chapter. Google's implementations illustrate mechanisms, not settings to copy unchanged. |
| [k6 arrival-rate executors](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/scenarios/concepts/arrival-rate-vu-allocation/) | Understand workload generation and virtual-user allocation for arrival-rate tests. | Intermediate; public reference. Generator capacity and dropped iterations can distort the apparent system limit. |
| [AWS Service Quotas documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/) | Investigate account and service limits that can block provisioning or scaling. | Intermediate; public documentation. Quota increases are not guaranteed and may not resolve regional resource scarcity. |

## Coverage

- Demand and workload modeling.
- Utilization, saturation and errors.
- Test-generator validity.
- CPU, memory, disk and network bottlenecks.
- Autoscaling, quotas and startup delays.
- Failure headroom and dependency limits.
- Capacity evidence, forecasting and economics.

## Reading and access

Foundation material assumes limited topic experience; intermediate material usually assumes basic implementation knowledge; advanced material often assumes practical systems or production experience. Each entry narrows those expectations where needed. Publicly readable instructions do not make a hosted service, commercial book, software license, or cloud experiment free.

Resource descriptions and destinations were reviewed on **5 October 2026**. Version, preview, development, and historical notes identify material that needs particular care. The linked manuals and collections are not claimed to have been read or tested in full. External links are used while repository resource IDs and canonical mappings remain unassigned.
