# DevOps Platform Engineer: Production Practice Resources

Use these references to operate platform capabilities through consumer success, failure diagnosis, and lifecycle maintenance. The platform needs service evidence of its own.

This page focuses on providing supported delivery capabilities that other engineers can use through predictable interfaces. **Question to keep in view:** Can a team complete a supported workflow and recover from failure without depending on undocumented platform knowledge?

## Measure task completion

Observe whether consumers can complete the supported workflow and how much assistance they need. Distinguish request acceptance, artifact generation, deployment completion, and useful service behavior. Each can fail independently and needs an appropriate status.

## Handle partial workflows visibly

A repository may exist even when deployment setup fails. Return or retain enough identity for reconciliation and support. Define which resources are retained, retried, or removed after failure and let users understand the consequences.

## Roll out platform changes deliberately

Test template, policy, and integration changes against representative consumers. Version consequential contracts, publish migration guidance, and monitor failure patterns. Keep exceptions owned and time-bounded where appropriate so they do not become invisible permanent paths.

## Apply guidance through an operating boundary

Start with the affected service, owner, current state, and authorized task. Establish a baseline and relevant acceptance evidence. Check data, identity, capacity, and recovery implications before proposing a change. After execution, verify the user or consumer outcome and any persistent side effects rather than relying only on a successful command.

## Selected resources

The order below is a task-based selection, not a requirement to complete every source. Detailed publisher, access, and limitation notes have one maintained home in the category reference directory.

### [Implementing SLOs](https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/)

**Use it to answer:** Which user behavior should be measured, what target matters, and how will the result inform a decision?

- **Start with:** Selecting indicators, targets, and the improvement process.
- **Prerequisites:** Understanding of user-visible service behavior.
- **Access and limits:** See the [maintained source annotation](../README.md#source-slo) for publisher context, access conditions, and the key limitation.

### [OpenTelemetry signals](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/)

**Use it to answer:** Which signals can connect the user symptom to the dependency or operation you need to inspect?

- **Start with:** Signals relevant to your diagnostic question.
- **Prerequisites:** Basic distributed application and observability concepts.
- **Access and limits:** See the [maintained source annotation](../README.md#source-otel) for publisher context, access conditions, and the key limitation.

### [Incident Response](https://sre.google/workbook/incident-response/)

**Use it to answer:** Who coordinates response, preserves the timeline, and verifies that the affected service has recovered?

- **Start with:** Coordination, roles, communication, and follow-up.
- **Prerequisites:** Understanding of service ownership and operational impact.
- **Access and limits:** See the [maintained source annotation](../README.md#source-incident) for publisher context, access conditions, and the key limitation.

### [GitHub Actions: Reuse workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/reuse-automations/reuse-workflows)

**Use it to answer:** How do consumers supply inputs and authority, and what happens when the shared contract changes?

- **Start with:** Inputs, secrets, permissions, and version references.
- **Prerequisites:** Working knowledge of a basic workflow.
- **Access and limits:** See the [maintained source annotation](../README.md#source-reuse) for publisher context, access conditions, and the key limitation.

### [Backstage permissions overview](https://backstage.io/docs/permissions/overview/)

**Use it to answer:** Where is the permission decision enforced and which plugin or downstream action must respect it?

- **Start with:** Permission concepts and policy integration.
- **Prerequisites:** Backend development and authentication familiarity.
- **Access and limits:** See the [maintained source annotation](../README.md#source-permissions) for publisher context, access conditions, and the key limitation.

## Apply the reading

Write a runbook for repository creation succeeding while deployment authorization fails. Include consumer messaging, resource ownership, policy diagnosis, reconciliation, and an end-to-end acceptance check.

### Evidence to keep

Record the question, environment or design assumptions, selected reference sections, your observations, and the reasoning behind the result. Label simulated examples and design-only work. Keep uncertainty separate from verified behavior, and remove private data from any evidence you publish.

### Decide what to study next

If the mechanism remains unclear, open the skills and learning pages. If the uncertainty concerns supported behavior, use official documentation. If it concerns an option or boundary, use architecture resources. If the result depends on execution evidence, choose a bounded project from the labs page rather than inferring success from reading.
